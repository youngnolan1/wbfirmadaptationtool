Follow these steps to start using the package:
1. You'll need to have the "devtools" R package installed - run install.packages("devtools")
2. You can then install the WB Firm Adaptation Tool package - run devtools::install_github("youngnolan1/wbfirmadaptationtool")
3. Finally, make sure to load this package as you would any other R package - run library(wbfirmadaptationtool)

Please see the example_analysis.R script for an outline of how to use the package's functions. You can download the script to your device and then edit the function inputs (which survey to look at, which variables to include in the regressions, etc) to suit your needs.
